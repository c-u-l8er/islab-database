OBSERVE user:alice WITH ENTANGLED PARTNERS;

-- Graph traversal through quantum entanglement
TRAVERSE FROM user:alice TO recommendations 
    VIA quantum_entanglement 
    WITH strength > 0.8;

-- Time-series analysis with relativistic effects
SELECT avg(temperature) FROM temporal:sensors
    WHERE time_range = 'last_24_hours'
    WITH entropy_optimization = true;

-- Document queries with gravitational routing
SELECT * FROM spacetime:products 
    WHERE category = 'electronics'
    ORDER BY gravitational_mass DESC;

-- Analytics with quantum enhancement
ANALYZE PATTERNS IN temporal:user_behavior
    USING quantum_correlation_boost = true
    WITH ml_model = 'temporal_prediction';
```
